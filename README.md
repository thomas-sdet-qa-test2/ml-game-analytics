## Machine Learning Game Analytics  

This project focuses on analyzing in-game player behavior using machine learning techniques to identify patterns and trends. The dataset includes player statistics, game session logs, and performance metrics extracted from competitive gaming scenarios.  

### Features  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Predictive modeling using regression and classification  
- Time-series analysis for player progression tracking  
- Automated data ingestion and pipeline orchestration  

### Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Apache Spark  
- Jupyter Notebooks
